A texture mod using Steamodded only (for now) to make Jimbo tiny! This is a WIP in the sense it does not retexture every asset yet, and will likely require Malverk once it does. 

For now, it should resprite Jokers, the standard deck of cards and all enhancements, all deck backs, as well as stickers, including stake stickers.

In order to install the mod, just download the code directly into a zip file using the shiny green button.

CURRENTLY ONLY IN 2X RESOLUTION, which hopefully isn't an issue. (im just too lazy rn)

i hope i did this right! - ness
